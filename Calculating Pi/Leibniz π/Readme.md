# Leibniz π/4 formula

We use Leibniz (π/4) formula. It states that

The alternating series can be written in the form of summation from 0 to infinity :

The series is convergent and continuous (Ref. Leibniz's test for convergence). The series converges to π(after multiplying by 4) when we take a sum of infinite terms. 
Since the convergence to π is very slow, the algorithm requires a summation of large terms to get an accurate value of π for small number of digits. 
In other terms, the algorithm is super slow to calculate the value of pi.
